# Scraply - Best Developer Tool (HackPrinceton Winner)
**A gamified deep learning playground with a scratch-like, no-code UI 🚀**

**What is Scraply?** Scraply is a web app where users can run neural networks using a scratch-like interface without using code, get suggestions to build an ideal model architecture for each level, and download the Python Notebook for their own model!

**Create your own Scrap Space!** Drag-and-drop "scraps" to start building your model. Experiment with different architectures and get quick training results! Scraply subtly gives suggestions and hints to level up, which unlocks a new dataset to use. Save your progress by creating an account with us.

**Development (Scrap-by-Scrap):** We use preloaded datasets and GPU acceleration with CUDA to allow our models to train quickly. With neural network models deployed through Flask, one of our concerns was managing our computations on the cloud. We used a Terraform configuration to monitor this for us, specified to run on AWS EC2 instances.

**Updates Coming Soon:**
👾 more scrap options
👾 vertical scrapyard
👾 explainability options
